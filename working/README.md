Ollama Agent Template for Microsoft Agent Framework
This is a starter template project for building AI agents using the Microsoft Agent Framework (formerly Semantic Kernel / AutoGen) powered by local LLMs via Ollama. It provides a pre-configured C# environment to bypass cloud-based LLM costs during development.  One built and installed you will be able to create a basic Ollama base agent project using 

```
dotnet new ollamaagent -o {project name}
```
